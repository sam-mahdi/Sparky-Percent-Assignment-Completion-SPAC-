# Sparky-Percent-Assignment-Completion-SPAC-
This program calculates what percentage of the backbone, alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epislon, and methlyl groups (ILVT) you have assigned. It uses the NMRSTAR format generated from https://github.com/sam-mahdi/SPARKY_to_NMSTAR3.1 This way i-1 amino acids will also be assigned. If the NMRSTAR programs input was only backbone information, then this script will only generate backbone information (i.e. you will get 0% output for your gamma,delta, epislon, and methyl groups).
